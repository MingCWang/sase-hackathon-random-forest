# UBelong

UBelong is an online sanctuary for students seeking solace from the isolating feelings of imposter syndrome. We've created a digital space where students can anonymously share and engage with one another's experiences across a variety of categories. From academic concerns to social anxieties, UBelong seeks to remind every student that they are not alone in their struggles and that their feelings are valid.

## Features

1. **Anonymity**: Users can converse and share their feelings without revealing their identities.
2. **Categorized Discussions**: Topics are organized into cards such as "Classes", "Relationships", "Social life", and "Jobs".
3. **Interactive Sticky Notes**: Each card contains floating sticky notes representing different discussions. Clicking a note will make others fade and present a discussion form.
4. **Live Counters**: Witness the number of peers sharing similar feelings in each category, reinforcing that you're not alone.
5. **Chatbot Integration**: Powered by OpenAI's state-of-the-art llm, our chatbot provides 1-on-1 support for users. This popup feature offers personalized engagement based on user preferences.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **AI**: OpenAI's llm API

## Proof of Concept

Given the limited timeframe, UBelong currently functions as a proof of concept. As such, user data and interactions are hardcoded examples. Our vision for the full-fledged version includes:

- **Relational Database**: Integration with PostgreSQL or a similar platform to store user-specific information, preferences, and chatbot interactions.
- **Personalized Chatbot Responses**: Recognizing the diverse mental and emotional states of our users, we aim to offer chatbot communication styles tailored to individual needs, ranging from humorous and light-hearted to sincere and comforting.
