					<p>Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their abilities and fear being exposed as frauds, despite their accomplishments. It was first described by psychologists Clance and Imes in a 1978 paper. Since then, numerous studies and resources have explored this phenomenon, including books like "The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women" by Valerie Young and "The Impostor Phenomenon" by Clance. TED Talks and Valerie Young's website also offer valuable insights and strategies to overcome it. Impostor syndrome can affect anyone and is characterized by self-doubt and attributing success to external factors, rather than one's own abilities. Recognizing it is the first step toward building self-confidence.</p>
